# Hangman-Python
Welcome to the MVC Implementation of the Hangman game in Python using pygame ! 

Beware, the words might not be that easy to guess ! 

The code consists of 4 modules - the model that contains the lexicon and the functions to interact with it, the controller that contains the logic of the game and the communication between the components, the view that contains the display setup and text rendering on the frontend and 'tests' which contains a set of python unit tests

To start the game, use main.py. 

You select the keys(characters) by clicking on their respective position on the screen. After 6 incorrect guesses, you are hanged !

The game will continue to play as long as you run it. If you would like to stop playing, close the window on the following game start screen 

Have fun guessing ! 

In case you get libpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile - please follow the guideline for removing the iCCP chunk from the PNG image:
